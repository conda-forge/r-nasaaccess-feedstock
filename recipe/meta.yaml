  summary: NASAaccess software can generate gridded ascii tables of CMIP5 and CMIP6 climate data as well as earth observation remote sensing data (GPM, TRMM, GLDAS) needed to drive various hydrological models (e.g., SWAT, VIC, DHSVM, RHESSys, â€¦etc.). The NASAaccess platform is available as software packages (i.e., conda and R packages) as well as an interactive format web-based environmental modeling application for earth observation data developed with the Tethys Platform.
  description: "Users need to set up a registration account(s) with
    Earthdata login as well as authorizing NASA GES DISC data access 
    to generate gridded ascii tables of climate and earth observation remote sensing data. 
    Please refer to \ <https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/information/documents?title=Data%20Access>
    for further details. Creating the '.netrc' file at the user machine Home directory 
    and storing the user NASA GES DISC logging information in it is done automatically to 
    execute the NASAaccess package commands. The GES DISC user registration access logging 
    information will be processed by masking in the terminal on any major OS. Without 
    providing GES DISC user registration access logging information, the user will 
    receive 'You need to provide your Earthdata GES DISC login to proceed\u2026' message."
